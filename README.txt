Fork of https://github.com/ibayer/CSparse/

This is a work in progress on acceleration using FPGAs.

Not all sources are included in this repository as yet.

Steps:

- Soft link lxbif.h from other sources to the Include directory

- In Demo directory run make, which will build Lib/libcsparse.a

Use this library in the application.
